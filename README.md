# OpenAI-API-tests

This repository provides examples of OPENAI API key usage:

1. Code samples with the OPENAI API that you can find in the "1. Testing functions.ipynb" Jupyter file.

2. A LangChain library usage example along with the OPENAI API is presented at the "2. Lang_Chain.ipynb" Jupyter file.

## Note:
To test this code, an OPENAI API key is needed. You can find this key at "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key"
